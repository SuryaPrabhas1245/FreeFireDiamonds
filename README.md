# FreeFireDiamonds
This is a fun project that mimics a Free Fire diamond generator interface. It includes:  A login page with fake Facebook and Google login buttons.  A diamond generator form where users can input their Free Fire ID and desired number of diamonds.  A simulated progress bar and success message for entertainment purposes.
